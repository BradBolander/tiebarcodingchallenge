# React / Three Ties
  This project was created primarily using React.js for the product list view, and Three.js for the 3D rendering of the bowtie.

# Other Resources
  I also used Magic CSS and Bootstrap for some front end styling. Node, NPM, and Express for my server, and it is hosted here at: https://thetiebar.herokuapp.com/
